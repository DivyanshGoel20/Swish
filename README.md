# 🚀 Swish

**Swish** is a Web3-powered social platform where expression meets ownership. It’s like your favorite social network, but every profile is an NFT, every connection has value, and every post can be open or exclusive.

Built on the **Core Blockchain**, Swish lets users post, follow, tip, and build communities — all while keeping ownership, privacy, and financial utility in focus.
